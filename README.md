# python_federal_provincial_tax_calculation

This is a class challenge from Sami that will count for 30 points

I was having a couple errors here and there, basically forgot to declare the calculations here and there, also not super used to all the math but I went back to the atm challenge we had a while back to copy a bit what I did to get it done.
